# xtreme fantasy xtended (js version)

Extreme fantasy, or xf for short, is despite it's name a really simple text/based action rpg where you, as a noble warrior, travel from town to town and kill evil monsters.

### Background
I wrote the first xf somewhere around 99/00 in ti83 basic for (and on) the ti83 graphic calculator.
Sometime around say 04/05 I tried to remake it in php and then later in c++ both significantly more advanced.
This time I am more or less recreating the original with a few, but less complicated enhancements, as a learing project for "webdev".

## todo

* Make enemies appear based on current level
* Rename shout to boast or something that won't be mixed up with shouts from elder scrolls
* Make ui hover to the side instead on bottom
* Change to tracery output instead of constant strings
* Rewrite fixed battle to states with defend and attack bonuses
